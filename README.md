# COVID19 Tracking for US States

This site contains alternate visualizations of the data from the
[COVID Tracking Project](https://covidtracking.com/). For reference,
Italian [data](https://github.com/pcm-dpc/COVID-19) from the
_Presidenza del Consiglio dei Ministri - Dipartimento della Protezione Civile_
is also included.

The approach taken here is similar to the approach taken by the
[Financial Times](https://www.ft.com/content/a26fbf7e-48f8-11ea-aeb3-955839e06441)
where the data for each country is overlaid on the same graph, aligned so that the
x-axis origin is the day the country first reported 100 positive cases ("day 0").

However, rather than comparing countries, these graphs compare different states
(and territories) in the US.

**Caveat**: The US has been seriously undertesting so far during this outbreak.
Because of this, these graph will likely underreport the actual situation until the
testing can be performed at a large scale. As states catch up on their testing, their
graphs will include large jumps. As testing coverage improves, the data presented here
will more accurately reflect the actual situation.
