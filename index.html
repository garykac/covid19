<h1>COVID19 Tracking for US States</h1>

<p>
This site contains alternate visualizations of the data from the
<a href="https://covidtracking.com/">COVID Tracking Project</a>. For reference,
Italian <a href="https://github.com/pcm-dpc/COVID-19">data</a> from the
<i>Presidenza del Consiglio dei Ministri - Dipartimento della Protezione Civile</i>
is also included.
</p>
<p>
The approach taken here is similar to the one taken by
<a href="https://twitter.com/jburnmurdoch/status/1240373707224363014">John Burn-Murdoch</a>'s
group at the
<a href="https://www.ft.com/content/a26fbf7e-48f8-11ea-aeb3-955839e06441">Financial Times</a>
where the data for each country is overlaid on the same graph, aligned so that the
x-axis origin is the day the country first achieved some reporting milestone ("day 0").
Others, like
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/fm0jvl/oc_update_chart_continuing_the_comparison_of/">dev_thetromboneguy</a>
on Reddit and
<a href="https://twitter.com/kendrickhang/status/1241110084597374977">Kendrick Hang</a>
on Twitter used a similar approach to create aligned tables comparing the US total and Italy.
</p>
<p>
However, rather than comparing entire countries, the graphs on this site compare and rank
different states (and territories) in the US.
</p>

<p>
<b>Caveat</b>: The US has been seriously undertesting so far during this outbreak.
Because of this, these graphs will underreport the actual situation until the
testing can be performed at a large scale. As states catch up on their testing, their
graphs will likely include large "correcting" jumps. As testing coverage improves, the
data presented here will more accurately reflect the actual situation.
</p>

<h2>Positive Cases Reported in US</h2>

<p>
These 2 graphs plot the same data: the number of positive cases reported each day for the
8 states that reported the largest number of cases.
The origin for each state is the day it first reported 100 positive cases.
</p>
<p>
The first graph uses a linear scale, while the second uses a log scale.
An aggretate total for the entire US and the data for Italy are also included for
reference.
</p>

<div class="graph"><img src="out-cases/cases-lin.gif" /></div>
<div class="graph"><img src="out-cases/cases-log.gif" /></div>
</div><!-- graphbox -->

<p>
One issue with the above graphs is that they don't take into account the state population:
1000 cases in a low-population state is more significant than the same number of cases
in a high-population state.
</p>

<h2>Positive Cases Reported in US (Normalized)</h2>

<p>
To account for the population variation, the next graphs take the same data as above,
but normalize the data for each state based on its population. The normalized data is
re-ranked to find the top 8 states. The "day 0" is based on when the state first
reported 10 positive cases per million residents.

<div class="graph"><img src="out-cases-norm/cases-lin.gif" /></div>
<div class="graph"><img src="out-cases-norm/cases-log.gif" /></div>
</div><!-- graphbox -->

<h2>Positive Cases for Individual States (Normalized)</h2>

<p>
The following graphs shows the normalized data (log-scale) for each state individually.
Just like the normalized graphs above, "day 0" is when the state first reported 10 positive cases per million residents.
Each graph contains the data for the states plotted in the background for reference.
</p>
<p>
A few regions (American Samoa, Northern Mariana Islands, Puerto Rico and West Virginia)
have not yet reached the '10 positive cases per million residents' threshold. The title
is grayed out for these graphs.

		Key takeaway:
		<ul><li>
			0.5% - 0.9% fatality rate for regions that are prepared and act early
		</li><li>
			3% - 5% fatality rate for regions that are overwhelmed (because of acting late or not being prepared)
